# The Hooper SMS RSVP App

## The History

- A group of 10-15 men would gather every Tuesday & Thursday morning at the
  local high school (E.P.B.P. Laker High School) gym at 6:00am to play pick-up
  basketball together for an hour.
- These pick-up basketball games were played in a 4-on-4 or a 5-on-5 format,
  requiring at least 8 players to show up for enough participants to play.
- As a way to ensure that they would never have mornings where only few showed
  up and no games could be played, the men appointed an unofficial "organizer"
  (Jeff Snider), who would send out an SMS message to each player the night
  before, requesting an RSVP reply via SMS message.
- Our unofficial "organizer", Jeff, moved away in 2017 and so the keys to the
  gym as well as the 'organizing torch' were both passed to me (Tico
  Thepsourinthone) to continue the tradition.
- With a 1-year old to chase after and my wife pregnant with child #2, I was
  forced to find a successor in 2019 who could carry on the tradition of
  gathering SMS RSVPs for morning basketball.
- Luckily, the up-and-coming, young hoop star, Logan Collison-Russell, stepped
  up and inherited the privilege of coordinating attendance for morning
  basketball through SMS RSVPs.

## The Problem

- Our young 'Padawan', Logan, is now in his senior year of high school and will
  be graduating soon with the class of 2022.
- With no one from the current morning hoop crew willing to volunteer themselves
  as the next "organizer", we run the possible risk of letting a great tradition
  die an unnecessary death...or is it actually necessary? (more on this under
  "The Solution"...)

## The Solution

- Since we can already summon a built-in digital assistant inside our handheld
  super computers like a genie from a bottle [using nothing more than a voice
  command], what is our excuse for not having a simple web app that can fully
  automate all tasks required to facilitate & coordinate morning pick-up
  basketball games between a few humans twice per week?

  - The answer: There's no excuse; just a solution. And this is it. This web app
    right here.
